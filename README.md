## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing Client Spending Data
**Code:** [`BSyw_Sample_Daily_Spending_Data.xlsx`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i2L4pGrTScCKoOFq0nozDbb1DQ9L03Gn&usp=drive_copy)

**Goal:** Provide an overview of spending patterns to help the client better understand their financial trends.

**Description:** This project examines the client's expenses, breaking them down by category, month, and fixed vs. variable costs. It highlights key spending trends and helps identify areas for potential budget adjustments.

**Skills:** Pivot tables, data visualization, financial analysis.

**Technology:** Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel.

**Results:** The client's overall spending has shown a steady increase month over month. Healthcare is the largest expense category, and fixed costs account for slightly more than half of variable expenses.

### Cleaning Data: U.S. Presidents Dataset
**Code:** [`BSyw Data Cleaning Project.xlsx`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nmlRq9wXxXU8C4ikruNM4myD5d9gRJ_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113591391992023438063&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Goal:** Ensure the accuracy and consistency of a dataset on U.S. presidents through data cleaning techniques.

**Description:** This project involves refining a Google Sheet where each row represents a U.S. president. The dataset may contain errors, missing values, or duplicates. The cleaning process includes correcting inaccuracies, standardizing formats, handling gaps, and removing duplicates to improve reliability.

**Skills:** Key skills for ensuring a clean, reliable dataset:
- Detecting and correcting errors
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Removing duplicates
- Using spreadsheet tools for efficient cleaning

**Technology:** Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel.

**Results:** A well-structured, error-free dataset ready for meaningful analysis of historical patterns and leadership traits.

### Essential Functions and Formulas
**Code:** [`BSyw Excel Functions.xlsx`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVspRNA8kDI2Q996mr4BzMJ5vN3UAMMZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113591391992023438063&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Goal:** Learn key data analysis and manipulation functions using Google Sheets.

**Description:** This project is a structured Google Sheet showcasing essential Excel and Google Sheets functions for data manipulation and analysis. It includes examples of XLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, ARRAYFORMULA, SUMIFS, COUNT, and IF statements, demonstrating how these functions streamline calculations and automate repetitive tasks.

**Skills:** Key data analytics functions and spreadsheet optimization:
- Data Manipulation: Using lookup functions, conditional aggregation, and logical expressions to refine datasets.
- Advanced Formulas: Leveraging XLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, SUMIFS, ARRAYFORMULA, and more for dynamic calculations.
- Problem-Solving: Applying analytical thinking to structure formulas that automate complex tasks.
- Spreadsheet Optimization: Utilizing efficient functions to enhance performance and usability within Google Sheets.
