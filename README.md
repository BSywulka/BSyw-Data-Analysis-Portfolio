 # Beth Sywulka - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
As an Information Management Specialist with a strong background in project management, teamwork, and technical skills, I'm expanding my expertise into Data Analytics. This GitHub portfolio tracks my learning journey and projects as I build proficiency in data analysis tools and techniques. I'm especially excited about using data to support informed decision-making, and I look forward to connecting with and learning from the data science community on GitHub.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing Client Spending Data
**Code:** [`BSyw_Sample_Daily_Spending_Data.xlsx`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i2L4pGrTScCKoOFq0nozDbb1DQ9L03Gn&usp=drive_copy)

**Goal:** Provide an overview of spending patterns to help the client better understand their financial trends.

**Description:** This project examines the client's expenses, breaking them down by category, month, and fixed vs. variable costs. It highlights key spending trends and helps identify areas for potential budget adjustments.

**Skills:** Pivot tables, data visualization, financial analysis.

**Technology:** Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel.

**Results:** The client's overall spending has shown a steady increase month over month. Healthcare is the largest expense category, and fixed costs account for slightly more than half of variable expenses.
