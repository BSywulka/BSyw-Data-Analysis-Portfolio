# Tianna Parris - Junior Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Tianna! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science). I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/tiannaparris/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Tianna%20Parris%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Movie Gross Earnings Analysis
**Code:** [`Python Correlation Project.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Python%20Correlation%20Project.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of movies released between 1980 and 2022.  The records include the title of the movies, it's rating, genre, release date, budget, gross, etc.. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing correlation between budget and gross earnings and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions to calculate and plot budget vs gross earnings, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result used to determine that Votes and budget have the highest correlation to gross earnings while the company has none.

### Tech Store Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tech%20Store%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions to calculate and visualize sales by month, city, the most common items sold and the reason this may be the case. 



### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries:%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.
